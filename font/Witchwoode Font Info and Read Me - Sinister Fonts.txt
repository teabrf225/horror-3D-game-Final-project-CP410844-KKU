Witchewoode Font by Chad Savage
https://www.sinisterfonts.com

Created 2024, hand-lettered.

This is a free font, and I mean FREE. Use it however you want, for whatever you want, for personal and commercial purposes (you do NOT need to email me and ask permission - this is that!). If you make something cool with it, I'd love to see it - email me at savage@sinister.me and tell me about it. If you offer it for download on your own font site, PLEASE include this Read Me. That's not too much to ask, is it?

This font is intended for specialty and graphic uses. It will look just awful if used in a paragraph format.

FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INSTALL/USE THIS FONT, visit https://www.sinisterfonts.com, or just look it up on Google. Seriously. Don't email me and ask - this information is easily found with a 20-second search.
